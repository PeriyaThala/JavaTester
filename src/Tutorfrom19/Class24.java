/* 
 * 5 types of inheritance
 * Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Multiple & hybrid -> at interface level
 * Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical -> at class level
 * Extends and Implements are two keywords used to achieve inheritance
 * Extends -> Class inherits Class, Interface inherits Interface
 * Implements -> Class inherits Interface
 * 
 * The child inheriting the properties of parents -> inheritance
 * The sub class inheriting the properties of the parent class is called inheritance
 * The differentiation of relationship between the sub class and class tells us what type of inheritance it is
 * refer inheritance package for examples
 * Single inheritance -> child has 1 on 1 relationship with parents
 * Multilevel Inheritance -> one class inheriting the other class which inherits the parent class
 * Hierarchical Inheritance -> Multiple immediate classes inherits from directly Base(parent) class
