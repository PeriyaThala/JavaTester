		// Access Modifiers in Java
		/*
		 * controls the access to the members of the class. Java provides 4 types of
		 * access modifiers 1. public 2. default 3. private 4. protected ### At the
		 * Class level only public and default are used classes defined as public can be
		 * accessed from another class of same package or of different package In order 
		 * to use all the classes of a particular package, we use import
		 * "Package name".* classes defined as default can be accessed only within the
		 * same package but different classes as well
		 * 
		 * 
		 * ### At the Variable/Method level all the above 4 are used within the same
		 * package + same class I can be able to access all the 4 types of variables or
		 * methods (access specifier) within the same package + different class -> I can
		 * able to access public, default, protected but not private Different package +
		 * different class -> only public methods/variables can be accessed ****
		 * Protected can be used in other package sub class but not in parent class ->
		 * this is possible in the concept of inheritance to use inheritance we need to
		 * use only 2 keywords -> "Implements" for interface, "extends" used to extend
		 * previous class in current class (eg: public class classB extends classA{})
		 *
